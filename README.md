# HCL-GUVI-career-carnival-hackathon
This project is made for hackathon conducted by HCL-GUVI career carnival. The project name is Hospital Resource Utilization &amp; Patient Outcomes Dashboard. I created hospital datasets with multiple tables such as patients, admissions, beds, resources, and staff using MySQL. Data cleaning and analysis were done using Python and SQL.
